Hi there

this is my first app based on Django. I think a lot of mistakes a shitcode be there, but I will make it better and better.

Idea is a simple family-tree catalogue-stylish. Users will create their own family trees, add persons, links between them

For first time i'm going to use sqlite for development and will rebase it in future (perhaps it will be postgre)

ofc in future here will be more informative data
